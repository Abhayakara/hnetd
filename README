hnetd - a home network configuration daemon


** Abstract **

hnetd is a networking daemon to automatically manage address assignment,
routing, DNS, SD and border firewalling in home networks running it.
It implements the Home Networking Control protocol as specified in
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-stenberg-homenet-hncp

hnetd is designed to run on generic Linux-based routers.


** Features **

1. State synchronization between routers
	a) link-local multicast transmission
	b) unicast fallback for bulk synchronization
	c) collision and conflict detection and resolving

2. Prefix distribution and allocation
	a) IPv6 prefix delegatuin
	b) IPv4 prefix allocation

3. Routing setup
	a) selection of a shared routing protocol
	b) fallback mechanism to setup routes autonomously

4. Dynamic border-detection for IPv4 and IPv6
	a) on-demand firewall reconfiguration
	b) on-demand RA/DHCP/DHCPv6 server configuration
	c) integration of fixed external connections (e.g. PPP, 6rd, ...)

5. Sharing of DNS and Service Discovery configuration
	a) Local DNS configuration
	b) mDNS / DNS-SD hybrid proxy configuration


** Compiling **

hnetd depends on the following libraries:
* libubox: http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=luci2/libubox.git
* libubus (OpenWrt only): http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=luci2/ubus.git

hnetd uses the following auxiliary tools (replacable):
* odhcp6c (DHCPv6 client): https://github.com/sbyx/odhcp6c
* odhcpd (RA/DHCP/DHCPv6 server): https://github.com/sbyx/odhcpd
* ohybridproxy (mDNS proxy, optional): https://github.com/sbyx/ohybridproxy
* udhcpc (DHCP client): http://busybox.net

hnetd uses cmake:
* To prepare a Makefile use:  "cmake ." 
* To build / install use: "make" / "make install" afterwards.
* To build DEB or RPM packages use: "make package" afterwards.


** Generic Firmware Integration **

hnetd can be integrated into generic Linux router firmwares with recent 3.10.x
or later kernels. The scripts that need to be adapted for the integration can
be found in the folder "generic".
