- IPv4 (oryon)
 - address assignment
 - prefix assignment (done?)
 - routing(?)

- IPv6
 - routing (sbyx; need testing)
 - prefix class support (sbyx; both odhcpd + here)

- prefix assignment
 - there seems to be issues; with random prefixes, lots of lap's wind
   up floating around when dp disappears and appears again; without
   random prefixes, problem is hopefully concealed..

- service discovery
 - make sure router names don't conflict with DDZs
 - fix IP address stuff to use iface

- L2 up/down detection on Linux; that is, we should ignore interfaces
  that aren't up
 - l2 down == no SD DDZ, no PA prefixes on link

- 'generic Linux' case needs to be tested thoroughly at some point
 - made it work within ttin too

- draft compliance
 - make sure implementations are in sync with what's in drafts
  - generic PA
  - generic SD
  - hncp
   - core
   - border discovery/PA
   - routing
   - SD

- get PCP in somehow?
 - it would be nice for IPv4 use for various cases; is it a priority though? hmm.
 (for IPv6 it is also relevant if it can make holes in incoming firewall)

- MLD? multicast routing?

- draft additions + implementation
 - downstream PD?
