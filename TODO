- IPv4 (oryon)
 - address assignment
 - prefix assignment (done?)
 - routing(?)

- IPv6
 - routing (sbyx; need testing)
  - seems to be 'slow' traceroute6 within 'home'; and exterior hop
    does not work (same config + Babel does work); have to track down
    why this happens..

- L2 up/down detection on Linux; that is, we should ignore interfaces
  that aren't up
 - l2 down == no SD DDZ, no PA prefixes on link

- 'generic Linux' case needs to be tested thoroughly at some point
 - made it work within ttin too

- make sure router names don't conflict with DDZs

- draft compliance
 - rename hcp -> hncp (sigh)
 - make sure implementations are in sync with what's in drafts
  - generic PA
  - hncp
  - hncp-border
  - hncp-routing
  - hncp-sd (+generic SD)

- get PCP in somehow?
 - it would be nice for IPv4 use for various cases; is it a priority though? hmm.
 (for IPv6 it is also relevant if it can make holes in incoming firewall)

- MLD? multicast routing?
