Done, but not tested
--------------------

- L2 up/down detection on Linux; that is, we should ignore interfaces
  that aren't up (test that this happens; code should work now)

Short-term things
-----------------

- IPv4 (oryon)
 - address assignment
 - prefix assignment (platform side done)
 - routing(done?)

- prefix assignment (oryon)
 - wait for new version, make sure it works (and hopefully has better
   delays than old)

- draft compliance
 - make sure implementations are in sync with what's in drafts
  - generic PA
  - generic SD
  - hncp
   - core
   - border discovery/PA
   - routing
   - SD

Eventually nice to have
-----------------------

- 'generic linux' case could support SD (=local dnsmasq configuration
  etc. just like on openwrt)

- get PCP in somehow?
 - it would be nice for IPv4 use for various cases; is it a priority though? hmm.
 (for IPv6 it is also relevant if it can make holes in incoming firewall)

- MLD? multicast routing?

- draft additions + implementation
 - downstream PD?
